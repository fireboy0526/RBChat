# RBChat

This is a personal interest project. The whole project is just trying to reclone a chat app. 

Currently this project uses Firebase instead of gcm.

Server side services haven't been added to the app yet.

Simple Google login integrated, with an option of creating a new account when server side service have been added.

Push notification working from Firebase and a temp server (which sends push notification to all devices or single devices).
Push notification supports small and large notification with custom ringtone.
